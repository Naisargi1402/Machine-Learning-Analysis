# Heart-disease-prediction
These days, a wide variety of disorders that potentially harm your heart are referred to as cardiovascular diseases. According to the World Health Organization, there are 17.9 million CVD-related deaths worldwide.

Adult deaths are primarily brought on by it. With the aid of their medical history, our initiative can identify individuals who are most likely to be diagnosed with heart disease. It can assist in identifying diseases with fewer medical tests and efficient treatments so that patients can be treated appropriately. It can identify anyone who is experiencing any heart disease symptoms, such as chest pain or high blood pressure.

Three data mining techniques—logistic regression, decision trees that are superior to earlier models, and random forest classifier—are the major emphasis of this study. Our project’s accuracy for a system using a single data mining technique is about to 86%. Thus, the accuracy and efficiency of HDPS were improved by applying more data mining techniques.

Based on the patient’s medical characteristics, such as gender, age, chest discomfort, fasting blood sugar level, etc., this study seeks to determine if the patient is likely to be diagnosed with any cardiovascular heart condition. The attributes and medical history of the patient are contained in a dataset chosen from the UCI repository. We make a prediction about the patient’s potential heart condition using this dataset. In order to forecast this, we utilize a patient’s medical characteristics to categorize him or determine whether he is likely to get one of 14 heart disorders. Three algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier—are used in this project because these algorithms seem to perform the best. The method with the highest accuracy, Logistic, has a precision rate of 86.88%.
