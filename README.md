# Cervical Cancer Prediction
Over the past few decades, cervical cancer has been one of the leading causes of death worldwide. After lung and breast cancer, it is the third most common type of cancer in women. It can be only detected at an early age and must be cured at that time. The stage describes how cancer has developed and spread throughout a woman’s body. Following a diagnostic test, doctors can determine cancer’s stage. Physicians can administer the proper course of treatment by understanding the proper stage of cervical cancer.

The IFOG (International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology) developed/recommended four cervical cancer phases. The doctors determine the stage after they have assessed the tumor and any lymph node or other body-wide dissemination.

According to studies, there are six primary signs and symptoms of cervical cancer: abnormal bleeding during or after menopause, abnormal vaginal discharge, exhaustion, and weight loss, pelvic and abdominal pain, and irritability while urinating. Long-term infection and infection from the human papillomavirus are the two primary causes of cervical cancer (HPV). For this project, we are going to use K Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Classifier.

The required modules for this project are –

Numpy(1.22.4) – pip install numpy
Tensorflow(2.9.0) – pip install TensorFlow
OpenCV(4.6.0) – pip install cv2
