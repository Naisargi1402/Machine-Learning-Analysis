# Thyroid-detection

Incidences of thyroid illness have increased recently. One of the most crucial roles in controlling metabolism belongs to the thyroid gland. Two of the most prevalent disorders caused by thyroid gland irregularities are hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Each year, a substantial number of patients are identified as having thyroid conditions such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Levothyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are produced by the thyroid gland, and both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can result from a lack of thyroid hormones.

In the literature, a variety of methods are suggested for diagnosing thyroid illness. In order to appropriately treat the patient at the appropriate time, save lives, and reduce medical costs, a proactive thyroid disease diagnosis is important.

Machine learning and deep learning techniques are used to forecast thyroid diagnosis in the early stages and identify the different types of thyroid disease, such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. This is possible because of technological breakthroughs in data processing and computation. Technologies like data mining, big data, image and video processing, and parallel computing have gotten advanced, and this has benefited the healthcare industry.

Applications for data mining in health care include early disease detection and diagnosis, virus outbreak forecasting, drug development, and testing, health care data management, patient-specific medication recommendations, etc. Healthcare experts work to recognize diseases in their earliest stages so that patients can receive the correct care and the condition can be cured quickly and cheaply. One of the illnesses that affect a major portion of people worldwide is thyroid disease.

The American Thyroid Association, the foremost professional organization in the world, estimates that 20 million Americans suffer from a thyroid condition. One in twelve Americans may receive a thyroid problem diagnosis at some point in their lives. According to these figures, thyroid-related illness should not be taken lightly. It would be ideal to use cutting-edge technologies to improve medical procedures for identifying and treating thyroid disorders.
