# Brain-tumor-detection

A brain tumor detection system is a system that will predict whether the given image of the brain has a tumor or not. The system will be used by hospitals to detect the patient’s brain. The doctor will take the MRI of the patient’s brain and will provide the image into the system and the system will then determine whether the brain has a tumor or not.
